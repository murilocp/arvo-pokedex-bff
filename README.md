## Pokedex BFF

This repository implements a BFF to call the Pokemon API and return only the necessary data.

### Install

To install the project run this command:

```bash
npm  install
# or
yarn
```

### Configuration

You must configure a `.env` file and add a `PORT` variable. There is an example that should help with the configuration.

### Example

If you are running in the port 8000, just open [http://localhost:8000/pokemon/pikachu](http://localhost:8000/pokemon/pikachu) in your browser to test if the BFF is working.
